Reflection

1. HTTP Request Path:

When I type my website URL in a browser:
1. Browser checks cache - Looks for saved info about the site
2. DNS lookup* - Finds the IP address for github.io
3. Request sent - Browser asks GitHub's servers for my site files
4. Response - GitHub sends back HTML, CSS, and images
5. Browser renders - Displays my website on screen

2. Docker vs GitHub Pages:

A Docker container is a complete and customizable environment that can run anywhere with its own operating system, databases, and backend code, while GitHub Pages only hosts static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with no server-side processing. The main difference is that Docker gives me full control over the environment like a virtual computer, and GitHub Pages is just for displaying built files with no backend capabilities.

3. AI Attribution:

I used ChatGPT for help with syntax questions like "how do I create a table in HTML" and "can you explain CSS specificity." One mistake the AI made was suggesting inline styles, which wouldn't work for this assignment. I fixed it by using #skills ul to override the regular ul selector.
